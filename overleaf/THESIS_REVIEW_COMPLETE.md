## Files Modified

### 1. `/home/pablo/aux/tfm/overleaf/Capitulos/Resumen.tex` (Abstract)

**Changes Made:**
- Added paragraph describing SCLIP exploration as secondary contribution
- Mentioned annotation-free setting and results (49.52% COCO-Stuff, 48.09% VOC)
- Highlighted 38.4× improvement over baseline on COCO-Stuff
- Positioned SCLIP work as complementary to main SAM2+CLIP approach

**Key Addition:**
```latex
Additionally, this thesis explores dense CLIP-based segmentation through SCLIP
(Self-attention CLIP), investigating an alternative training-free approach that
modifies CLIP's attention mechanism with Cross-layer Self-Attention (CSA) and
integrates SAM2 for mask refinement. Our SCLIP implementation achieves 49.52%
mIoU on COCO-Stuff and 48.09% mIoU on PASCAL VOC in a fully annotation-free
setting, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods (38.4× on
COCO-Stuff) and providing insights into the complementary strengths of
proposal-based versus dense prediction approaches.

\item \textbf{Exploration of dense CLIP-based segmentation via SCLIP:}
We investigate an alternative training-free approach based on SCLIP \cite{sclip2024},
implementing Cross-layer Self-Attention (CSA) modifications to CLIP's architecture
and integrating SAM2 for mask refinement. This exploration achieves 49.52% mIoU on
COCO-Stuff and 48.09% mIoU on PASCAL VOC in annotation-free settings, providing
comparative insights into proposal-based versus dense prediction methodologies and
demonstrating text feature caching optimization for 41% inference speedup.
