- **Achievement:** 49.52% mIoU COCO-Stuff, 48.09% mIoU PASCAL VOC
- **Setting:** Training-free, fully unseen classes

---

## Review Tasks

### 1. ✅ ABSTRACT (Resumen.tex) - CURRENT STATUS
**Current Focus:** SAM2 + CLIP system only
**Issues:**
- Doesn't mention SCLIP work at all
- Only covers first system (69.3% mIoU on VOC)
- Missing comprehensive contribution summary

**Action Needed:**
- Keep primary focus on SAM2+CLIP (main contribution)
- Add brief mention of SCLIP exploration as secondary contribution
- Update to reflect full scope of thesis

---

### 2. ✅ INTRODUCTION (Introduccion.tex) - NEEDS UPDATE

#### Current Contributions Listed:
1. Development of open-vocabulary system (SAM2+CLIP)
2. Multi-scale CLIP voting strategy
3. Multi-instance selection strategy
4. Integration with generative AI
5. Evaluation on PASCAL VOC (69.3% mIoU)
6. Insights into challenges

**Missing:**
- SCLIP exploration and CSA attention work
- SAM2 refinement strategy contribution
- Dual-approach comparison (SAM2+CLIP vs. SCLIP)

**Action Needed:**
- Add 7th contribution about SCLIP dense prediction exploration
- Mention both approaches in thesis structure
- Clarify this is comprehensive exploration of CLIP-based segmentation

---

### 3. ✅ METHODOLOGY (Capitulo2.tex) - REVIEW NEEDED

**Current Content:**
- System Overview (4 stages)
- Dense Vision-Language Features (CLIPSeg + MaskCLIP approaches)
- SAM 2 Mask Generation
- [Need to read rest...]

**Needs Review For:**
- Is SCLIP methodology covered here or separate?
- Implementation details completeness
- System architecture clarity
- Missing technical details?

---

### 4. ✅ EXPERIMENTS (Capitulo3.tex) - MAJOR UPDATE NEEDED

**Current Datasets:**
- COCO-Stuff 164K
- PASCAL VOC 2012
- ADE20K
- COCO Open-Vocabulary Split
- Custom Test Set

**Current Metrics:**
- Segmentation: mIoU, Precision, Recall, F1
- Open-Vocabulary: Zero-Shot mIoU, Retrieval@K
- Generation: FID, CLIP Score, User Study

**Action Needed:**
- **Find ALL baseline metrics from related work**
- **Add placeholders for our SCLIP results**
- **Write analysis based on current 49.52% / 48.09% results**
- **Create comparison tables with proper citations**

---

## Priority Actions

### HIGH PRIORITY:

1. **Update Abstract** - Add SCLIP work summary
2. **Update Introduction Contributions** - Add 7th contribution
3. **Update Experiments Chapter** - Add SCLIP results section

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:

4. **Review Methodology** - Ensure SCLIP approach covered
5. **Add Comparison Tables** - SCLIP vs. related methods
6. **Write Analysis** - Interpret current results

### LOW PRIORITY:

7. **Update Conclusion** - Reflect both contributions
8. **Polish Writing** - Consistency across chapters

---

## Metrics Collection Task

### Methods to Find Metrics For:

**From SCLIP chapter citations:**
1. MaskCLIP (ECCV 2022)
2. MaskCLIP+ (self-training variant)
3. DenseCLIP (CVPR 2022)
4. ITACLIP (arXiv 2024)
5. CLIP-DIY (WACV 2024)
6. LSeg (ICLR 2022)
7. GroupViT (CVPR 2022)
8. OVSeg (CVPR 2023)
9. CLIPSeg (CVPR 2022)
10. CAT-Seg (CVPR 2024)

**Datasets to Extract:**
- PASCAL VOC 2012 mIoU
- COCO-Stuff mIoU
- Zero-shot splits
- Annotation-free settings

---

## Placeholder Strategy

### For Metrics We Haven't Run Yet:

```latex
\textbf{[RESULT PLACEHOLDER: XX.XX\%]}
```

### For Full Dataset Runs:

```latex
% NOTE: Preliminary results on subset. Full dataset pending.
mIoU (preliminary): 49.52\% → \textbf{[FINAL: XX.XX\%]}
```

### For Ablation Studies:

```latex
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Ablation Study - CSA vs. Standard Attention}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
Method & COCO-Stuff & PASCAL VOC \\
\hline
Standard CLIP & \textbf{[TBD]} & \textbf{[TBD]} \\
SCLIP (CSA) & 49.52\% & 48.09\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

## Analysis Writing Guide

### What We Know (From Session Summary):
- **COCO-Stuff:** 49.52% mIoU (38.4× improvement over 1.29% baseline)
- **PASCAL VOC:** 48.09% mIoU (10.3× improvement over 4.68% baseline)
- **Text Caching:** 41% speedup (37.55s → 26.57s)
- **SAM Parameter Optimization:** +5.1% improvement
- **Top Classes:** leaves (91.22%), bear (91.19%), clock (87.94%)
- **Challenging Classes:** person (1.55%), bottle (0.08%)

### Analysis Points to Make:

1. **Strengths:**
   - Massive improvement over naive CLIP baseline
   - Training-free approach (no fine-tuning needed)
   - SAM2 refinement provides clean boundaries
   - Scales to 171 classes (COCO-Stuff)

2. **Comparisons:**
   - vs. ITACLIP (67.9% VOC): Different settings (they use seen labels)
   - vs. MaskCLIP+ (86.1% VOC): Different settings (zero-shot with seen labels)
   - Our setting: Truly training-free, fully unseen

3. **Limitations:**
   - Small object detection still challenging
   - Some spurious predictions (visualizations show noise)
   - Slower than real-time (26-38s per image)

4. **Future Work:**
   - Confidence filtering (+3-5% expected)
   - Better text prompts (+2-3% expected)
   - CRF post-processing (+2-4% expected)

## Next Steps

1. I'll create updated versions of:
   - Abstract (Resumen.tex)
   - Introduction Contributions
   - Experiments Results Section

2. I'll extract metrics from papers:
   - Read MaskCLIP paper results
   - Read ITACLIP results
   - Read other baselines

3. I'll create comparison tables with:
   - Our results (current + placeholders)
   - Baseline results (from papers)
   - Proper citations
