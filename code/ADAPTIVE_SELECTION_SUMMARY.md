# Adaptive Mask Selection - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

**Challenge:** How many masks should we select when SAM 2 generates hundreds of overlapping candidates?

**Examples that illustrate the problem:**
- Query: **"car"** → Should select 1 complete vehicle (not parts)
- Query: **"tire"** → Should select 4 individual tires (all parts)
- Query: **"mountain"** → Should select N masks (all distinct mountains)

Traditional fixed `top-K` selection fails because it doesn't adapt to the semantic granularity of different queries.

## Solution Overview

The adaptive selection system automatically determines how many masks to select by:

1. **Analyzing query semantics** - Detects singular/plural, parts/wholes, stuff categories
2. **Building mask hierarchies** - Identifies parent-child containment relationships
3. **Detecting score clusters** - Finds natural groupings in similarity scores
4. **Applying smart strategies** - Uses different selection logic per query type

## Quick Start

### Command Line

```bash
# Traditional fixed selection
python main.py --image street.jpg --prompt "cars" --top-k 5

# NEW: Adaptive selection
python main.py --image street.jpg --prompt "cars" --adaptive
```

### Python API

```python
from pipeline import OpenVocabSegmentationPipeline

pipeline = OpenVocabSegmentationPipeline()

# Enable adaptive selection
result = pipeline.segment(
    image="street.jpg",
    text_prompt="tires",
    use_adaptive_selection=True  # ← New parameter
)

print(f"Selected {len(result.segmentation_masks)} masks")
# Output: Selected 4 masks (automatically detected all tires)
```

### Demo

```bash
# Run comprehensive comparison on your image
python demo_adaptive_selection.py --image your_image.jpg

# Test query analysis only (no image needed)
python demo_adaptive_selection.py --analysis-only
```

## How It Works

### 1. Query Analysis

Classifies queries into semantic categories:

| Query Type | Examples | Strategy |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Singular** | "car", "the building" | Select top 1 mask |
| **Parts** | "tires", "windows" | Select all at same level |
| **Instances** | "cars", "people", "mountains" | Select non-overlapping |
| **Stuff** | "sky", "grass", "water" | Select largest region |

**Implementation:** Linguistic heuristics check for:
- Plural forms (ends with 's', irregular plurals like "people")
- Part-of relationships (tire, window, door, wheel, etc.)
- Stuff categories (sky, grass, water, etc.)
- Plural markers ("all", "multiple", "several")

### 2. Mask Hierarchy

Analyzes spatial relationships between masks:

```
Example hierarchy for a car image:

Level 0: [Complete car body]
         ├─ Level 1: [Front section]
         │           ├─ Level 2: [Front wheel]
         │           └─ Level 2: [Headlight]
         └─ Level 1: [Rear section]
                     ├─ Level 2: [Rear wheel]
                     └─ Level 2: [Taillight]
```

**Usage:**
- Query "car" → Select level 0 (complete object)
- Query "wheels" → Select level 2 (all wheels)

**Implementation:** Computes pairwise IoU to detect containment (IoU ≥ 0.8 with different sizes)

### 3. Score Clustering

Detects natural breaks in similarity scores:

```
Scores: [0.75, 0.72, 0.70,  | gap |  0.45, 0.42,  | gap |  0.15, 0.12]
        [--- Cluster 1 ---]          [-- Cl. 2 --]        [- Cl. 3 -]
```

**Strategy:** Split at gaps larger than mean + std

### 4. Selection Strategies

**Singular (e.g., "car"):**
```python
return [highest_scoring_mask]
```

**Parts (e.g., "tires"):**
```python
# Get masks with similar scores at same hierarchy level
threshold = top_score - 0.15
return [mask for mask in masks
        if mask.score >= threshold
        and mask.level == most_common_level]
```

**Instances (e.g., "cars"):**
```python
# Keep non-overlapping high-scoring masks
selected = []
for mask in first_cluster:
    if not overlaps_with_selected(mask, selected):
        selected.append(mask)
return selected
```

**Stuff (e.g., "sky"):**
```python
# Return largest high-scoring mask
return [max(top_masks, key=lambda m: m.area)]
```

## Thesis Integration

This can be added to your thesis as:

### Chapter 3: Methodology Extension
**Section 3.4: Adaptive Mask Selection**

Traditional open-vocabulary systems use fixed top-K, which fails for:
- Singular objects (selects too many)
- Part queries (may miss some parts)
- Instance queries (arbitrary cutoff)

Our approach:
1. Semantic query classification
2. Hierarchical mask analysis
3. Adaptive selection strategies

### Chapter 4: Experiments
**Section 4.X: Adaptive Selection Evaluation**

Compare fixed vs. adaptive on:
- Object queries: "car", "building" (expect 1)
- Part queries: "wheels", "windows" (expect multiple)
- Instance queries: "people", "cars" (expect all)
- Stuff queries: "sky", "grass" (expect 1 large)

**Metrics:**
- Selection accuracy (% queries with correct count)
- User preference study
- Computational overhead

## Example Comparisons

### Query: "car"
```
Fixed top-5:  [car_body, front_section, wheel, door, window]
              ❌ Includes parts when user wanted whole car

Adaptive:     [car_body]
              ✅ Correctly selects complete vehicle
```

### Query: "tires"
```
Fixed top-5:  [tire1, tire2, tire3, tire4, rim]
              ⚠️ Includes rim (different semantic category)

Adaptive:     [tire1, tire2, tire3, tire4]
              ✅ Correctly selects only tires
```

### Query: "mountains"
```
Fixed top-5:  [mtn1, mtn2, mtn3, mtn4, mtn5]
              ⚠️ Only 3 mountains exist, included 2 false positives

Adaptive:     [mtn1, mtn2, mtn3]
              ✅ Correctly identifies all distinct mountains
```

## Configuration

```python
AdaptiveMaskSelector(
    score_gap_threshold=0.1,      # Minimum gap to split clusters
    min_overlap_ratio=0.8,        # IoU for parent-child
    max_masks_per_query=20        # Safety limit
)
```

## Limitations & Future Work

**Current limitations:**
1. Simple plural detection (fails on "cactus" → "cacti")
2. English-only linguistic analysis
3. No spatial reasoning ("left tire" vs "all tires")
4. Fixed part-of dictionary (not learned)

**Future improvements:**
1. **Language model integration** - Use GPT/BERT for semantic understanding
2. **Spatial queries** - Handle "cars on the left", "mountains in background"
3. **Visual context** - Scene understanding affects interpretation
4. **Learning** - Update strategies based on user feedback
5. **Multilingual** - Support other languages

## Visualization

The system provides hierarchy visualization showing:
- Selected masks (colored by level)
- Rejected masks (grayed out)
- Bounding boxes with scores
- Level annotations

```python
vis = selector.visualize_hierarchy(
    image, masks, hierarchy, selected_indices
)
```

## Code Structure

```python
class AdaptiveMaskSelector:
    def select_masks_adaptive(masks, text_prompt, image_shape):
        """Main entry point - returns selected masks + debug info"""
        semantic_type = _analyze_prompt(text_prompt)
        hierarchy = _build_mask_hierarchy(masks)
        clusters = _detect_score_clusters(masks)

        if semantic_type == "singular":
            return _select_singular(masks)
        elif semantic_type == "parts":
            return _select_parts(masks, hierarchy)
        # ... etc

    def _analyze_prompt(text_prompt):
        """Returns: semantic_type, prompt_info"""
        # Check plural, parts, stuff categories

    def _build_mask_hierarchy(masks):
        """Returns: hierarchy dict with parent/children/level"""
        # Compute IoU, detect containment

    def _detect_score_clusters(masks):
        """Returns: list of clusters (score-based grouping)"""
        # Find gaps in similarity scores
```

## Dependencies

No new dependencies! Uses existing:
- numpy (mask operations, IoU computation)
- Standard library (re, dataclasses, typing)

## Integration Points

**Modified files:**
1. `pipeline.py` - Added `use_adaptive_selection` parameter
2. `main.py` - Added `--adaptive` CLI flag
3. `models/` - New `adaptive_selection.py` module

**Backward compatible:** Old code works unchanged, new parameter is optional.

## Citation

If you use this in your thesis, you can describe it as:

> "We propose an adaptive mask selection strategy that automatically determines the appropriate number of masks based on query semantics, eliminating the need for fixed top-K selection. The system classifies queries into semantic categories (singular objects, parts, instances, stuff) and applies category-specific selection strategies using hierarchical mask analysis and score clustering."
